# 👩🏽‍🏫 Teacher

Content delivery for [Cursor](https://github.com/awaseem/cursor)

# How does it work?

Any changes to master will trigger a redeploy within vercel that hosts the data files. The app calls these files like any other API, parses them and then presents the content.

This way if I need to change anything related to the courses or content, I just make a small commit into master and boom everything is redeployed. The best part is this costs me zero dollars and get a bunch of added features like caching and worldwide CDN support. You can view the data here: teacher.getcursor.app
